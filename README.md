### Gemail-Hack

### python script for Hack gmail account brute force 

### I've noticed a lot on this forum and other sites that Gmail is really difficult to crack with Hydra
mostly because companies like Google have taken precautions against it. I've had some decent success with Hydra 
against Gmail, but decided to write my own dictionary attack script to see if I could do any better
Well, I wrote my script to use TLS on port 587 instead of Hydra using SSL on 465. So far I've 
found I've had a MUCH higher success rate
